## belly-button-challenge

# For this assignment, I took information on bacteria biodiversity and created an app to visualize the data. The bacteria was found inside patients' bellybuttons! The app was created with HTML and Javascript and uses a drop down menu to select a specific patient and their bacteria cultures.

# I utilized resources from GitHub, Google, past challenges, Youtube, and help from a coding friend for this assignment.
